# Battery-Health-Analysis-using-EIS-and-ICA-with-Machine-Learning
This project analyzes lithium-ion battery aging using EIS and ICA data. It includes 3D visualizations of impedance and capacity shifts over cycles and builds a machine learning model to predict current capacity, helping estimate remaining useful life (RUL) and understand degradation patterns.
